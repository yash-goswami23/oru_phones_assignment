## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project is a Flutter-based mobile application that includes authentication, home screen, and notifications functionalities. It follows a clean architecture and utilizes BLoC (Business Logic Component) for state management.


## ðŸš€ State Management
The project uses BLoC (Business Logic Component) for efficient state management. It ensures:

Separation of UI and business logic

Predictable state changes

Better testability

The BLoC structure is implemented for authentication and home features:

Auth BLoC (auth_bloc, auth_event, auth_state)

Home BLoC (home_bloc, home_event, home_state)
